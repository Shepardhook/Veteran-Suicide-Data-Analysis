Introduction
Veteran suicide is a significant concern, and understanding the trends over time can help inform strategies for prevention. This notebook analyzes historical data to uncover patterns in veteran suicides by region and year.

Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information related to veteran suicides, including:

Year: The year of the recorded suicide.
Region: The region where the suicide was recorded.
Suicide: The number of suicides reported.
Additional details about the dataset and source can be provided here.

Data Cleaning and Preparation
Before analysis, the data undergoes a cleaning process to:

Remove or fill missing values.
Filter data based on specific columns such as 'Year' and 'Region'.
Analysis and Visualizations
Key analyses performed in the notebook include:

Yearly Trends: Visualizing suicide rates over the years for each region using line plots.
Regional Breakdown: Examining how suicide rates differ across various regions.
Additional analyses can be detailed here.
Requirements
Python 3.10
